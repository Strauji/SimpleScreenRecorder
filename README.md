# SimpleScreenRecorder
I've always struggled to record my clips from my game **VoidStrike: the Online SpaceShooter** using the available screen recorders with good quality and good framerate because my computer is just... a potato.
So i've decided to take the a shot and solve that problem, so i've written this small program that will record your screen from command line, it took me like 1-2 hours to learn OpenCV and write that, so don't expect much, i plan to make a graphic interface in the future to allow you to configure better what you want to record, but for now you'll have to change the variables in code.

# How to use
First of all you'll need to have Python 3, and install the dependecies, as the follow:

**Numpy:**
Run in your terminal/console:  
> 	pip install numpy
> 
**Pyautogui:**
Run in your terminal/console:  
> 	pip install pyautogui
> 
**OpenCV:**
Run in your terminal/console:  
> 	pip install opencv-python
> 
**PIL:**
Run in your terminal/console:  
> 	pip install pillow

After all of that your system will have the dependencies necessary to run this code, so you can just

>py -3.8 simplescreenrecorder.py

# Notes:
A small preview screen will pop, it signals that the code is already running.
To finish the gravation you'll need to press lowcase "q"
